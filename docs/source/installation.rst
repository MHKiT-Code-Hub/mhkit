Python Installation
=============

The following section includes installation instructions for `MHKiT-Python <https://github.com/MHKiT-Software/MHKiT-Python>`_.


MHKiT-Python
-------------

`MHKiT-Python <https://github.com/MHKiT-Software/MHKiT-Python>`_ requires `Python (3.8+) <https://www.python.org/>`_  and has several Python package dependencies.
It is recommended to use the `Anaconda Python Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ to install Python since it includes most of MHKiT-Python's package dependencies.
Refer to the `Python website <https://www.python.org/>`_ for information on using Python.

.. Note::
    The installation of Anaconda3 no longer adds python to the Windows Environment Variables by default. During installation, there is a checkbox in the advanced options of the installation to add it to the system path. The installation wizard advises against doing so in case a user has multiple python installations. Either check this box or setup your environmental variables so that python is accessible through your system path.

    Click `here <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows>`_ for more information.

.. Note::
	Mac computers come with Python 2.7 pre-installed. MHKiT does not 
	work with Python 2.7.  A second version of Python (3.7+) will need to 
	be installed on your machine. DO NOT DELETE Python 2.7. Use the above 
	steps to make sure MATLAB is running the proper version of Python.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`MHKiT-Python <https://github.com/MHKiT-Software/MHKiT-Python>`_ requires `Python (3.8+) <https://www.python.org/>`_  and has the following Python packages dependencies:

* `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_: used for data storage and analysis
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_: used for data storage and analysis
* `SciPy <https://docs.scipy.org>`_: used for numerical methods, statistics, and signal processing
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_: used to produce figures
* `Requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/>`_: used to get data from websites
* `Pecos v0.1.9 <https://pecos.readthedocs.io/>`_: used for quality control analysis

It is recommended to use the `Anaconda Python Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ because it includes all of the MHKiT-Python package dependencies except Pecos.


Install MHKiT-Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Option 1: PIP Install from Python
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This option is recommended for MHKiT-Python users.
To install MHKiT-Python using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_::

	pip install mhkit

Using this option to install MHKiT-Python will automatically install Pecos.


Option 2: Clone Repository from GitHub
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This option is recommended for MHKiT-Python developers.
To install MHKiT-Python using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_::

	git clone https://github.com/MHKiT-Software/MHKiT-Python
	cd mhkit-python
	pip install -e .

Using this option to install MHKiT-Python will require following the `Pecos installation instructions <https://pecos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ to install the Pecos package dependency.

.. Note::
	If you plan to contribute to the MHKiT-Python open-source software, please `fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ the MHKiT-Python repository into your GitHub user account.
	To include your additions to the MHKiT-Python code, please submit a `pull request <https://github.com/MHKiT-Software/MHKiT-Python/pulls>`_ in the MHKiT-Python master branch.
	Once reviewed by the MHKiT-Python development team, pull requests will be merged into MHKiT-Python and included in future releases of MHKiT-Python.


Test MHKiT-Python installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test that MHKiT-Python is installed correctly, open a Python console and run::

    import mhkit

If MHKiT-Python is installed properly, Python proceeds to the next line and no other output is printed to the screen.
If MHKiT-Python is not installed properly, the user will see the following error::

    ImportError: No module named mhkit

To test a simple function using MHKiT-Python, the user can compute the equivalent diameter (ED) and projected capture area (AP) of a circular turbine by running the following code::

    [ED, AP] = mhkit.river.performance.circular(30)
    print(ED)
    print(AP)

The results should be::

	ED = 30
	AP = 11309.7
