DOLfYN Module
=============
DOLfYN is the Doppler Oceanography Library for pYthoN. 
It is designed to read and work with Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP/ADCP) data. 
DOLfYN includes libraries for reading Nortek (tm) and Teledyne RDI (tm) binary data files.

The DOLfYN module currently contains the following submodules:

* ``io``: Reads binary functions from acoustic Doppler instruments.
* ``rotate``: Rotates an instrument's vector data through various coordinate systems, or frames of reference.
* ``time``: Converts time to different formats (e.g. epoch time, datetime, datenum, time strings)
* ``tools``: Other useful functions from the codebase

See :ref:`MHKiT-Python <python>` for more details on the DOLfYN module.
